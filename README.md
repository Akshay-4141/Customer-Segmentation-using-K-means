## **Project Overview**
Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses to understand their customer base better, tailor marketing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction. In this project, we utilized machine learning techniques, including K-Means clustering, to segment customers based on features such as age, gender,profession, and spending score.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including their gender, age, marital status, profession, spending score, and other attributes. The dataset were taken from kaggle.com.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.
README.md: Project documentation (you are here).

## **Dependencies**
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Usage
Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and execute the code.

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebooks to preprocess the data, build the machine learning model, and perform customer segmentation.
